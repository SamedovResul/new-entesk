                UniGalax is created by ROYBI’s team with over 20 years of experience in education, technology, AI/ML, and marketing. In 2019, ROYBI introduced the first-ever AI-powered multilingual educational robot that became TIME Magazine’s Best Invention in Education and won the World Economic Forum Smart Toy Award in 2021. ROYBI’s products are now being used by thousands of kids, parents, and educators worldwide.

                But as innovative as ROYBI is, ROYBI can only impact one child at a time. And our ultimate mission? To provide one-to-many educational impact for students of all ages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, we’re creating the go-to universe for students to learn. ROYBI will still exist, but only as a small part of UniGalax. Educators, universities, coaches, and platforms will form the core of UniGalax.
